# **Social Debiasing for Fair Multi-modal LLMs**

This repository is the official implementation of our paper [Social Debiasing for Fair Multi-modal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06569), which will appear at ICCV 2025.

In this work, we take an initial step toward mitigating social biases in multimodal LLMs through a counter-stereotype debiasing (CSD) approach, and we construct a counterfactual dataset, CMSC.

You can access and download the images of CMSC dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHV8ao8og-oTVhFYq6e0PI7m4zz6sAUl/view?usp=sharing).

**No EULA is required, as all social labels are annotated directly in the filenames.**
